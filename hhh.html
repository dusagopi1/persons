        <h2>Impacts of Doping</h2>

        <h3>1. Suspension and Bans</h3>
        <p>
            Athletes caught doping face suspensions or lifetime bans from their sport. 
            This not only halts their careers but also tarnishes their legacy. The loss of 
            endorsements and sponsorships is common, leading to significant financial losses. 
            Their reputation is often irreparably damaged, impacting future opportunities even outside of sports.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Impact on Team and Nation</h3>
        <p>
            The integrity and performance of the entire team can be called into question. 
            Teammates may face increased scrutiny and pressure. National pride and international 
            reputation can suffer, leading to potential sanctions or exclusion from international competitions. 
            Trust in sports organizations and fairness in competition can diminish among fans and stakeholders.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Psychological Effects</h3>
        <p>
            Athletes may experience guilt, anxiety, and depression due to their actions and the resulting consequences. 
            The stress of maintaining the deception, fear of getting caught, and handling public backlash can be overwhelming. 
            The loss of identity as a respected athlete can lead to long-term psychological issues.
